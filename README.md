# Quiz-By-Billy
Code for a timed multiple choice quiz.
## Overview
 This is the 6th challenge of my bootcamp in Front-End Web Development. This challenge has been instrumental in building myself a better foundation for my understanding of more indepth JavaScript code concepts such as object methods, localStorage, JSON, DOM manipulation, and implementing timers.

## Description
This challenge involved designing a timed multiple choice quiz to test a users' knowledge of basic coding concepts. It notifies the user of whether their answer is correct or incorrect by displaying a message either congratulating the user or deducting 10 seconds from the remaining time. Additionally, the quiz includes an alert when the time limit is reached, indicating the completion of the quiz. Sound effects have also been utilised to further display whether an answer is correct or not.
When the user has completed the quiz, they are presented with their final score and asked to input their initials to be entered onto a list of highscores, which in future the user can choose to wipe the high scores from the local storage.
